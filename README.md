A compiled list of Docker Composes samples.

These examples provide a starting point on how to integrate different services using a Compose file and manage their distribution with Docker Compose.

I am preparing these examples for setting up projects and experimenting with software stacks in local development environments and for easy access when needed

## Samples

1. Angular
2. Wordpress / MySQL
